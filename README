The parser is in parser.y and the scanner is in scanner.l
main.c traverses the scanner as tokens come in and decides what to print in binary.
You may need to install yacc and flex.

Just do make and then run ./opt testing.txt in cmd.
If all goes well, you should have a single warning about yyparse.

The final goal is to be able to get proper output for finaltest.txt

N Instructions

Framework setup, need to write support in main.c:
R and W Instructions
Assembly sections: begin, end.


Need to setup and write:
More instructions
Assembly Sections: word.
comments.


Bugs:
If not sending the output anywhere in N Instructions, the assembler breaks.
The address slot for targets is gibberish sometimes right now due to a malloc bug.

Parts I need to read about in papers and figure out:
Exactly what addresses for targets? Is it the offset from current? Absolute? Just the N[3] == target = 3? need to figure out.
